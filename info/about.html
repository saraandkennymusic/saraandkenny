		<p>Born into a multicultural and musical family, <span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Sara</span> grew up in Southern Italy where she was exposed early to a variety of musical genres and expressions.<br><br>

She began writing her own music from an early age, even before she began training in classical guitar. While obtaining her degree at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory of Rome, Italy, she continued cultivating her love for singer-songwriting and all types of musical genres by playing and singing in a variety of groups and ensembles.<br><br>

She moved to the USA in 2010, and since then has been continuing to grow musically by teaching and performing both as a solo artist and with other musicians coming from a variety of backgrounds and genres.<br><br>


A native of Brookfield, Wisconsin, <span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Kenny</span> began his study of classical piano at age five and guitar at age twelve. He began his early jazz studies with local guitar veteran Roger Brotherhood. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Milwaukee Youth Symphony Orchestra Jazz Studies program studying under Ethan Bender, Barry Oosterwaal, and Neil Davis. Kenny also attended the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music under the direction of Eric Jacobson. During his high school years Kenny won various outstanding soloist awards, including “Best Class A Soloist” at the prestigious Eau Claire Jazz Festival.<br><br>

Kenny attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA, studying with greats such as Sheryl Bailey, Larry Baione, Jeff Galindo, John Funkhouser, and John Baboian. He has since then returned to Milwaukee, where he currently lives and actively plays.<br><br>


<span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Sara</span> and <span style="color: #fcf9b6;">Kenny</span> met in Milwaukee through a shared love of the growing improvised music scene. They immediately connected and started working on original music in April 2015. An eclectic blend of nylon string and steel string guitars, Sara and Kenny embrace their wide range of musical styles to create their intimate sound.<br><br>


Their repertoire varies from original music, Jazz and Blues, Latin American, Italian singer songwriter classics to contemporary rock songs.
